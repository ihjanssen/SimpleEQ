# SimpleEQ
An EQ plugin initially built by following this guide: (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_Iq4_Kd7Rc&amp;t=401s) to be expanded upon later with a proper GUI, more
parametric bands, and an integrated multiband compressor.

4/30/23 - Pulled existing code into github. Currently stock JUCE GUI, with one parametric band and high/low pass filters.
